in lvgl/demo_lvgl/main.py:

create the label, LEDvalueLbl, and update with color val on clicks
this will help render the UI hopefully


in /main.py
trying to add my RGB LED control page to the multipage
weird errors:
    name 'LEDvalueLbl' isn't defined
    can't cancel self
    
maybe the functions have to be defined in a different order?
